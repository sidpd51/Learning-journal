## [Enable third-party](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/customer-service/develop/third-party-co-browse) cobrowse and screen sharing

### Prerequisites

-   An active digital messaging or chat subscription.
-   Updated Omnichannel base and Omnichannel chat solution with third-party cobrowse externalities enabled.

## Unified routing in customer service

### Embellish

-   Service requests may originate from social media, a direct message, a phone call, or an email. To ensure that the work is assigned to the most appropriate agent, work items must include the right details.

### Rules+ML

-   User logical rules + ML models to achieve better classification.

### Multi-stage

-   Classify in stages to use the output of one step as an input to the next.
-   Multiple classification stages in an ordered fashion

## Send the customer to the right queue

### Queue routing rules

-   Determine the destination for a work item based on specified conditions, with a default queue assigned if no rules match.

### select the best queue

-   During runtime, the system considers rule conditions and queue operating hours to assign a work item to a queue, with priority given to the first rule that matches the condition. If no rules apply, the work item is sent to the default queue(works as safety net).

## Handle sudden surge in customer queries using overflow managment

### Manage workload effectively

-   Use overflow settings across channels to manage sudden surge in demand or out of operating hours.(Advance queue)

### Reduce customer wait time

-   Transfer work items to different queues if agent assigment is taking time in the current queue and customers are getting impacted

### Handle non-operating hours

-   Use overflow levers like voicemail or transfer queries to queue that are in operating hours

## Effecient distribution of workload

### Achieve higher employee engagement with omnichannel work distribution

-   Omnichannel: unified routing powers all the first party channels; i.e., voice, live chat, async messaging channels, records e.g., cases and leads, activities like emails and tasks

-   Blended workforce: agents today are expected to multitask unified routing provides real-time presence and enhanced capactiy management for the work assigned to these "blended" agents on all channels.

-   Work distribution (in workstream)

## [Prioritize the important customers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NEaSwMeCztM&list=PLU_AWHqxQB_889XAxrudF_QxS6UCZ_-fk&index=5)

-   Prioritize important items: Ensure that work is assigned in order of organization specific priorities. For example, you can author rules to prioritize service requests for premium customers
-   Priority buckets and order: Work items are put into a priority bucket inside the queue, and then those buckets are sorted.
-   If you change any attributes of the work item, such as the priority of the case, that change will be considered during the next assignment cycle.
